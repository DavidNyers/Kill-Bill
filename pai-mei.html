            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
              Pai Mei was a legendary master of the Bak Mei and Eagle's Claw
              styles of kung fu. He was the teacher of Bill, Elle Driver, and
              Beatrix Kiddo, and was responsible for the removal of Elle's right
              eye. He taught Beatrix the fatal movement known as the Five Point
              Palm Exploding Heart Technique and the Three Inch Punch. Pai Mei
              was poisoned by Elle, as revenge for snatching out her eye.

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
              Pai Mei was cruel and domineering in his teaching. Punishing and
              chastising his students, he often sought to humble them early on
              and was especially merciless if he caught any defiance in their
              demeanor. Despite Pai Mei's sexist and racist attitude, he was
              rather an open minded individual. After seeing Beatrix's tenacity
              in her training, he saw potential in her and eventually taught her
              the Five-Point-Palm Exploding Heart Technique, a technique he has
              not taught a single student before her.

            <h2>Legends</h2>
            <p>
              Years before the Massacre at Two Pines, Bill told Beatrix the
              legend he once heard of Pai Mei and his Five Point Palm Exploding
              Heart Technique. Back in 1003 (one-double [n]aught-three) in
              China, as Pai Mei was traveling down a road, a Shaolin monk
              crossed paths with him. Pai Mei gave a slight nod to the monk, who
              did not return it. Although the motives of the monk remain
              unknown, whether it was an insult or a misunderstanding, Pai Mei
              tracked him down at the Shaolin Temple. He demanded that the head
              Abbot kill himself as a means of retribution, but the Abbot
              refused. Consequently, Pai Mei single-handedly massacred all 60 of
              the monks residing in the temple.

            <h2>Bill and Elle's training</h2>
            <p>
              Pai Mei was the master of Bill and Elle Driver. He taught them the
              style of kung fu known as Bak Mei. During his training, Bill
              learned that Pai Mei hated "Caucasians", Americans, and the
              Japanese, in addition to being contemptuous of women. During her
              own personal training, Elle called Pai Mei a "miserable, old
              fool," a statement that triggered Pai Mei's fury, which resulted
              in Elle losing her right eye. From that day forward, Elle harbored
              a powerful hatred of Pai Mei.

            <h2>Beatrix's training</h2>
            <p>
              Pai Mei was approached by Bill, who asked if he would teach
              Beatrix the secrets of kung fu. Precipitated by a disagreement of
              unknown subject matter, Bill and Pai Mei had a brief fight, after
              which Pai Mei accepted Beatrix as his new pupil. Pai Mei and Bride
              Pai Mei telling Beatrix what she is here to do. After Beatrix
              entered his garden and training area, Pai Mei decried her Mandarin
              as "lousy," in addition to lambasting her for being a woman. After
              asking what skills she possessed, Pai Mei ordered her to
              demonstrate them. He then ordered her to go to the rack of Jians
              and withdraw one, challenging that if she could land a single blow
              against him, he would bow to her and call her master. Pai Mei

              her attacks without difficulty. During the fight, Pai Mei disarmed
              Beatrix and told her that she had shown nothing to him so far.

              arts. As the fight resumed, Beatrix was still unable to hit Pai
              Mei, who blocked and dodged all of her attacks. After she was
              knocked to the ground, Beatrix tried to use a rock to strike him.
              Aware of what she was doing, Pai Mei grabbed her arm and twisted
              it behind her back. ChapterPaiMei Pai Mei telling Beatrix she is
              not his superior. In pain, Beatrix admitted that Pai Mei was
              superior and acknowledged her subservience. Satisfied, Pai Mei
              told her that her training would begin the next day. Pai Mei
              teaching Bride Punch Pai Mei teaching Beatrix the Three Inch
              Punch. Pai Mei started Beatrix's training; whether it was carrying
              water buckets up a stony staircase, using the Three inch punch to
              break a block of wood or performing the Bak Mei moves. Pai Mei
              Rice Pai Mei and Beatrix having dinner. Pai Mei also taught
              Beatrix manners; as was shown, during dinner, Beatrix's found it
              very hard to eat white rice with chopsticks (as her hand was
              severely hurt from hitting wood), so she attempted to eat with her
              hands. Annoyed, Pai Mei threw the bowl to the floor, commenting
              that if she wanted to be treated as a human, she ought to eat like
              one. Eventually, Beatrix progressed in her training so much that
              she managed to do what almost no-one (man or woman) had managed to
              do before: she gained Pai Mei's respect and approval, so much so
              that he decided to teach her his most coveted and dangerous move,
              the Five-Point-Palm Exploding Heart Technique, which she would
              later use to kill Bill. All of this was beyond impressive,
              especially since Pai Mei had vowed never to teach anybody the
              move. DeathEdit Pai Mei Death Pai Mei is poisoned and killed by
              Elle Driver. At some point after Beatrix finished her training,
              Elle killed Pai Mei by poisoning his fish heads. As Pai Mei was
              dying, he said, "Elle, you treacherous dog . . . I give you my
              word . . . " Elle stood above him, laughing; she said to him "To
              me, the word of an old fool like you is worth less than nothing."
              She then contemptuously kicked him to the ground and watched him
              die, cursing her to his last breath. Years later, Elle revealed
              what she had done to Beatrix, taunting her over having murdered
              her mentor. Enraged, Beatrix attacked Elle and, in a tribute to
              Pai Mei, plucked out and crushed Elle's remaining eye as
              vengeance. Beatrix's revenge against the Deadly Viper
              Assassination Squad was based on Pai Mei's training. She ordered
              the surviving members of the Crazy 88 to leave behind the limbs
              they had lost as those lost limbs belonged to Beatrix. The arm
              that Beatrix used to blind Elle was the arm that Pai Mei stated
              belonged to him after Beatrix lost her first training fight.
