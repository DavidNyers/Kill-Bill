              "Kill Bill: Volume 1" was released in theaters on October 10,
              2003. It was the first Tarantino film in six years since "Jackie
              Brown" was released in 1997. In the United States and Canada,
              "Volume 1" was released in 3,102 theaters and grossed $22 million
              on its opening weekend. It ranked first at the box office, beating
              "School of Rock" (in its second weekend) and "Intolerable Cruelty"
              (in its first). "Volume 1" was the widest theatrical release of
              Tarantino's career to date, and it was also his highest-grossing
              opening weekend to date. Previously, "Jackie Brown" and "Pulp
              Fiction" (the latter released in 1994) had each grossed $9.3
              million on their opening weekends. Paul Dergarabedian, president
              of Exhibitor Relations, said "Volume 1" 's opening weekend gross
              was significant for a "very genre specific and very violent" film
              that in the United States was restricted to theatergoers 17 years
              old and up. According to the studio, exit polls showed that 90% of
              the audience was interested in seeing the second volume after
              seeing the first.
